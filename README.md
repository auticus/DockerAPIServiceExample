# DockerAPIServiceExample
This example shows how to set up an aspnet core api project and build it in docker and then access it via docker

You can run this via HTTP or HTTPS in visual studio as it exposes port 80 and 443.  However when running the stand-alone build, without an SSL cert you will only have access to port 80.
